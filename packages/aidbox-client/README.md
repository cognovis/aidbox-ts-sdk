<p align="center">
  A TypeScript client for interacting with a FHIR server.
</p>

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@health-samurai/aidbox-client"><img src="https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@health-samurai/aidbox-client/alpha" alt="npm"></a>
  <a href="https://healthsamurai.github.io/aidbox-ts-sdk/aidbox-client/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-typedoc-blue" alt="API Docs"></a>
</p>

## Usage

The client is created with the `makeClient` function:

```typescript
const baseUrl = "https://fhir-server.address";
const client = new AidboxClient(
  baseUrl,
  new BrowserAuthProvider(baseUrl),
);
```

## Documentation

Documentation is generated automatically, and can be found [here](https://healthsamurai.github.io/aidbox-ts-sdk/aidbox-client/).

## Type Generator

This project is designed around the type generator that provides FHIR types based on the specified package.
However, not all types are provided in the client itself, only the necessary ones, like `Bundle`, and `OperationOutcome`.
If your application requires more types, use [atomic-ehr/codegen](https://github.com/atomic-ehr/codegen) to generate more types.

For example, using `atomic-ehr/codegen`, we can generate and import an `Observation` type, and ensure that all fields are provided when creating a resource:

```typescript
import type { Observation } from "hl7-fhir-r4-core";

client.create<Observation>({
  resourceType: "Observation",
  status: "final",
  code: {
    coding: [{
      system: "http://loinc.org",
      code: "59408-5",
      display: "Blood pressure systolic & diastolic"
    }],
    text: "Blood pressure"
  },
  subject: {
    reference: "Patient/pt-1"
  },
  effectiveDateTime: "2025-12-05T00:00:00Z",
  valueString: "minimal"
})
```

The default set of types in the client is based on FHIR R4 Core.
If your application requires a different set of types, it is possible to override that through type parameters when creating a client:

```typescript
import type * as R5 from "hl7-fhir-r5-core";
import type { User } from "@health-samurai/aidbox-client";

const baseUrl = "https://fhir-server.address";

const client = new AidboxClient<R5.Bundle, R5.OperationOutcome, User> (
  baseUrl,
  new BrowserAuthProvider(baseUrl),
);
```

## [FHIR Interactions](https://hl7.org/fhir/http.html)

This client provides a set of methods to work with a FHIR server in a more convenient way:

- Instance Level Interaction
  - `read` - Read the current state of the resource
  - `vread` - Read the state of a specific version of the resource
  - `update` - Update an existing resource by its id (or create it if it is new)
  - `conditionalUpdate` - Update an existing resource based on some identification criteria (or create it if it is new).
  - `patch` - Update an existing resource by posting a set of changes to it.
  - `conditionalPatch` - Update an existing resource, based on some identification criteria, by posting a set of changes to it.
  - `delete` - Delete a resource.
  - `deleteHistory` - Delete all historical versions of a resource.
  - `deleteHistoryVersion` - Delete a specific version of a resource.
  - `history` - Retrieve the change history for a particular resource.
- Type Level Interaction
  - `create` - Create a new resource with a server assigned id
  - `conditionalCreate` - Create a new resource with a server assigned id if an equivalent resource does not already exist.
  - `search` - Search the resource type based on some filter criteria.
  - `conditionalDelete` - Conditional delete a single or multiple resources based on some identification criteria.
  - `history` - Retrieve the change history for a particular resource type.
- Whole System Interaction
  - `capabilities` - Get a capability statement for the system.
  - `batch`/`transaction` - Perform multiple interactions (e.g., create, read, update, delete, patch, and/or [extended operations]) in a single interaction.
  - `delete` - Conditional Delete across all resource types based on some filter criteria.
  - `history` - Retrieve the change history for all resources.
  - `search` - Search across all resource types based on some filter criteria.
- Compartment Interaction
  - `search` - Search resources associated with a specific compartment instance (see [Search Contexts](https://build.fhir.org/search.html#searchcontexts) and [Compartments](https://build.fhir.org/compartmentdefinition.html))
- Search Continuation
  - `searchPage` - Follow one continuation link of a search result Bundle to read the page it points to.
- Operations Framework
  - `operation` - Perform an operation as defined by an `OperationDefinition`.
  - `validate` - Perform the Validate Operation.

### Patient CRUD Example

Here's an example of

```typescript
import { AidboxClient, BrowserAuthProvider } from "@health-samurai/aidbox-client";
import type { Patient } from "hl7-fhir-r4-core";
import { formatOperationOutcome } from "utils";

const client = new AidboxClient(
  "http://localhost:8080",
  new BrowserAuthProvider("http://localhost:8080"),
);

// Create a new Patient resource
const result = await client.create<Patient>({
  type: "Patient",
  resource: {
    gender: "female",
    resourceType: "Patient",
  },
});

// Check if interaction was successful
if (result.isErr())
  throw Error(formatOperationOutcome(result.value.resource), {
    cause: result.value.resource,
  });

const patient = result.value.resource;

if (!patient.id)
  throw Error(
    "id is optional in FHIR, so we check it to satisfy the type checker",
  );

// Updating the patient

patient.name = [
  {
    given: ["Jane"],
    family: "Doe",
  },
];

const updateResult = await client.update<Patient>({
  id: patient.id,
  type: "Patient",
  resource: patient,
});

if (updateResult.isErr())
  throw Error(formatOperationOutcome(updateResult.value.resource), {
    cause: updateResult.value.resource,
  });

// Deleting the patient

const deleteResult = await client.delete<Patient>({
  id: patient.id,
  type: "Patient",
});

if (deleteResult.isErr())
  throw Error(formatOperationOutcome(deleteResult.value.resource), {
    cause: deleteResult.value.resource,
  });
```

### Paging Through Search Results

A search response is a Bundle whose `link` entries carry the URLs of the neighbouring pages.
`searchPage` follows exactly one of those links:

```typescript
const firstPage = await client.searchType({
  type: "Patient",
  query: [["_count", "20"]],
});

if (firstPage.isErr())
  throw new Error("search failed", { cause: firstPage.value.resource });

const secondPage = await client.searchPage({
  bundle: firstPage.value.resource,
  relation: "next", // the default; "previous", "prev", "first" and "last" also work
});
```

`relation` defaults to `next`, and a Bundle without a link for the requested relation is refused, so the end of a
result set is reported instead of being retried.
A continuation URL that was selected elsewhere can be passed directly as `await client.searchPage({ url })`,
relative to the FHIR base or absolute.

The client does not page automatically: one call reads one page, and following further pages is up to the caller.
It also does not interpret the returned Bundle, so `Bundle.entry.search.mode` and profile-aware typing stay with the
caller.

Continuation URLs come from the server, so they are resolved and checked before a request is made.
A URL that resolves outside the configured origin or outside the `/fhir` base path of the configured base URL is
rejected with a `RequestError` and no request is sent, which keeps the credentials of the auth provider from being
sent to another host.
The same applies to a URL that only looks confined, such as one carrying credentials, an encoded path separator, or a
path that would be re-read as a reference to another host.

### Return data format

As seen in the example above, most methods return a `Result<T, E>` object.
This object represents a successful or erroneous state of the response.

A general usage pattern is as follows:

```typescript
const result = await client.read<Patient>({ type: 'Patient', id: 'patient-id' });

if (result.isErr())
  throw new Error("error reading Patient", { cause: result.value.resource })

const patient = result.value.resource;

// work with patient.
```

It is also possible to work with resources without unwrapping the `Result` object:

```typescript
const result = await client.read<Patient>({ type: 'Patient', id: 'patient-id' });

return result
  .map(({resource}: {resource: Patient}): Patient => {
  /* work with Patient resource */
  })
  .mapErr(({resource}: {resource: OperationOutcome}): OperationOutcome => {
  /* work with OperationOutcome resource */
  });
  // result is still Result<Patient, OperationOutcome>
```

See the [documentation](https://healthsamurai.github.io/aidbox-ts-sdk/aidbox-client/) for more info.

## Low-level methods

The client provides two basic methods for writing custom interactions:

- `rawRequest` - send request to the FHIR server and receive response in a raw format
- `request<T>` - send request to the FHIR server and receive response with its body parsed to the specified type `T`

In a successful case, the `rawRequest` returns an object with JavaScript Response and additional meta information.
When the server responds with an error code, this function throws an error:

```typescript
const result = await client.rawRequest({
  method: "GET",
  url: "/fhir/Patient/patient-id",
  headers: {Accept: "application/json"},
  params: [["some" "parameters"], ["if", "needed"]],
}).then((result) => {
  const patient: Patient = await result.response.json();
  // ...
}).catch((error) => {
  if (error instanceof ErrorResponse) {
    const outcome = await error.responseWithMeta.response.json
    // ...
  }
});
```

Alternatively, the `request` method can be used.
It returns a `Result<T, OperationOutcome>`, which contains an already parsed result, coerced to the specified type `T`.

```typescript
const result: Result<Patient, OperationOutcome> = client.request<Patient>({
  method: "GET",
  url: "/fhir/Patient/patient-id",
  headers: {Accept: "application/json"},
  params: [["some" "parameters"], ["if", "needed"]],
});

if (result.isOk()) {
  const patient: Patient = result.value.resource;
  // work with patient
}

if (result.isErr()) {
  const outcome: OperationOutcome = result.value.resource;
  // process OperationOutcome
}
```

Both methods can throw the `RequestError` class if the error happened before the request was actually made.

## Aidbox-specific methods

Beside the FHIR interactions, the client exposes methods for Aidbox-specific endpoints.

### Bulk import (`/v2/fhir/$import`)

`bulkImport` submits an import operation and returns a handle to it.
`bulkImportStatus` reads the state the server reports for that operation.

```typescript
const submission = await client.bulkImport({
  contentEncoding: "plain",
  inputs: [
    { resourceType: "Patient", url: "https://storage.example.com/patients.ndjson" },
  ],
});

if (submission.isErr())
  throw new Error("import was rejected", { cause: submission.value.resource });

const { id, statusUrl } = submission.value;

const status = await client.bulkImportStatus({ id, statusUrl });

if (status.isOk()) {
  const { status: state, outcome, inputs, result } = status.value.resource;
  // state is "in-progress" or "done"; inputs keeps the per-file outcome, counts, and errors.
}
```

These are primitives, not a workflow. The client does not poll, retry, validate resources, or interpret partial results — a caller decides when to ask again, what a partial failure means, and whether a submission may be repeated. Aidbox imports are not idempotent, so a submission is never retried by the client; an ambiguous response is returned to the caller as it is. Note that an auth provider may re-send a request that the server rejected as unauthenticated (HTTP 401) before processing it, after refreshing its credentials.

Only a same-origin `/v2/$import/<id>` status location is followed. A missing, malformed, foreign-origin, credential-bearing, or off-path `Content-Location`, one carrying a query or a fragment, or one addressing another operation id than the caller supplied, makes `bulkImport` throw `ErrorResponse` with the server response attached; a tampered or inconsistent handle makes `bulkImportStatus` throw `RequestError` before any authenticated request is sent. Operation ids containing `/` or `\` are refused as well, because Aidbox decodes them before routing and the status path would then not address the import.

Beside the FHIR interactions, the client exposes a few Aidbox-specific endpoints, such as `sql`, `materialize`, `userinfo` and `logout`.

### Batch validation (`$batch-validate`, Aidbox 2607+)

Requires Aidbox 2607 or later.

`$batch-validate` validates resources that are already stored, for one resource type and a required time window.
Aidbox answers a synchronous run with a summary, and an asynchronous run with a task that can be polled, drilled down into, and cancelled.

This API only exposes the operation and its reports.
It does not decide when to validate, it does not poll or time out, and it does not repair, tag, or quarantine resources.
Deciding what to do with a finding is left to the caller.
Only same-origin `/fhir/$batch-validate/...` links are followed: a task handle or a report link that points anywhere else is refused with a `RequestError` before any authenticated request is sent.

Start a run and read the summary:

```typescript
const started = await client.batchValidate({
  type: "Patient",
  since: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z", // required, sent as the _since parameter
  until: "2024-02-01T00:00:00Z", // optional
  profiles: ["http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient"], // optional, sent as repeated profile parameters
});

if (started.isOk() && started.value.kind === "summary") {
  const { summary } = started.value;
  console.log(summary.validated, summary.valid, summary.invalid);
  for (const issue of summary.issues) {
    console.log(issue.code, issue.expression, issue.count, issue.diagnostics);
  }
  // summary.parameters keeps the raw Parameters resource
}
```

Start the same run asynchronously, then read its state:

```typescript
const accepted = await client.batchValidate({
  type: "Patient",
  since: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  respondAsync: true, // sends the Prefer: respond-async header
});

if (accepted.isOk() && accepted.value.kind === "task") {
  const { handle } = accepted.value; // { taskId, statusUrl }

  const status = await client.batchValidateStatus(handle);
  if (status.isOk() && status.value.kind === "in-progress") {
    // the task is still running; the server's informational OperationOutcome
    // is available as status.value.outcome
  }
  if (status.isOk() && status.value.kind === "summary") {
    console.log(status.value.summary.invalid);
  }
}
```

Read the invalid resources of a task, page by page:

```typescript
const report = await client.batchValidateInvalidResources({
  handle,
  count: 100,
  page: 1,
  issues: ["7809a723232eecba055729af1049e127"], // optional, repeated _issue filter
});

if (report.isOk()) {
  for (const invalid of report.value.resource.resources) {
    console.log(invalid.fullUrl); // versioned URL of the offending resource
    console.log(invalid.resource); // the stored resource, as sent by the server
    console.log(invalid.outcome); // the OperationOutcome of that resource
  }
}
```

Walk the pages with `count` and `page`, up to the reported `total`:

```typescript
const count = 100;
for (let page = 1; ; page++) {
  const page_ = await client.batchValidateInvalidResources({ handle, count, page });
  if (!page_.isOk()) break;

  const { resources, total } = page_.value.resource;
  if (resources.length === 0) break;
  // work with resources
  if (total !== undefined && page * count >= total) break;
}
```

`selfUrl` and `nextUrl` carry the links of the report itself.
`nextUrl` is present only when the server supplies a `next` parameter; a link taken from a report can be followed as-is:

```typescript
const { nextUrl } = report.value.resource;
if (nextUrl) await client.batchValidateInvalidResources({ url: nextUrl });
```

Cancel a task:

```typescript
const cancelled = await client.batchValidateCancel(handle);
if (cancelled.isOk()) {
  console.log(cancelled.value.outcome); // the server's OperationOutcome
}
```

Every summary and invalid-resources report keeps the raw `Parameters` resource under `parameters`, so parameters and parts this client does not model stay available; task, in-progress, and cancel results carry the server's `OperationOutcome` under `outcome`.
Options this client does not model can be sent as raw `Parameters.parameter` entries through the `parameters` field of the start request.
The Aidbox build this was written against accepts exactly `_since`, `_until` and `profile`, and answers an unknown parameter name with HTTP 422.

## Authentication Providers

Authentication is managed via the `AuthProvider` interface. The client ships with five built-in providers:

| Provider | Environment | Auth Method |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `BrowserAuthProvider` | Browser | Cookie-based sessions |
| `BasicAuthProvider` | Any | HTTP Basic Auth |
| `ClientCredentialsAuthProvider` | Server-side | OAuth 2.0 client_credentials with a shared client secret |
| `SmartBackendServicesAuthProvider` | Server-side | OAuth 2.0 client_credentials with JWT bearer |
| `SmartAppLaunchAuthProvider` | Browser or server | SMART App Launch (OAuth 2.0 authorization_code with PKCE) |

### BrowserAuthProvider

For browser applications. Uses cookie-based sessions and redirects to the login page on 401.

```typescript
import { AidboxClient, BrowserAuthProvider } from "@health-samurai/aidbox-client";

const baseUrl = "https://fhir-server.address";
const client = new AidboxClient(baseUrl, new BrowserAuthProvider(baseUrl));
```

### BasicAuthProvider

For server-side applications using HTTP Basic Auth.

```typescript
import { AidboxClient, BasicAuthProvider } from "@health-samurai/aidbox-client";

const baseUrl = "https://fhir-server.address";
const client = new AidboxClient(
  baseUrl,
  new BasicAuthProvider(baseUrl, "username", "password"),
);
```

### ClientCredentialsAuthProvider

For confidential server applications that hold a client ID and a shared client secret (Aidbox `Client.secret`). Uses the OAuth 2.0 client_credentials grant against `<baseUrl>/auth/token`.

Features:
- Token caching with proactive refresh before expiry
- Thundering herd prevention — concurrent requests share a single token fetch
- Automatic retry on 401 with a fresh token, as long as the request body is replayable
- Client secret and access token live in private fields, are never serialized, and are redacted from token endpoint errors

```typescript
import { AidboxClient, ClientCredentialsAuthProvider } from "@health-samurai/aidbox-client";

const auth = new ClientCredentialsAuthProvider({
  baseUrl: "https://fhir-server.address",
  clientId: "my-service",
  clientSecret: process.env.AIDBOX_CLIENT_SECRET as string,
  // scope: "system/*.read",                  // Optional: sent only when supplied
  // tokenEndpoint: "https://fhir-server.address/auth/token", // Optional: defaults to `<baseUrl>/auth/token`
  // clientAuthentication: "basic",           // Optional: "basic" (default) or "body"
  // tokenExpirationBuffer: 30,               // Optional: seconds before expiry to refresh (default: 30)
  // allowInsecureRequests: false,            // Optional: development only, permits a plain http token endpoint
});

const client = new AidboxClient("https://fhir-server.address", auth);
```

`clientAuthentication` selects how the client authenticates at the token endpoint. `"basic"` sends an `Authorization: Basic` header holding the base64 of the raw UTF-8 `clientId:clientSecret`, `"body"` sends `client_id` and `client_secret` as form fields. Credentials are never placed in a URL. Aidbox accepts both forms.

The token endpoint receives the client secret, so it is validated at construction time: it has to be an absolute `https:` URL without userinfo or fragment, and the token request is sent with `redirect: "manual"` so a redirect can never replay the credentials to another origin. Plain `http:` is refused unless `allowInsecureRequests` is set, which is meant for local development against `http://localhost` only.

When `baseUrl` carries a path prefix (for example `https://host/aidbox`), the default endpoint still resolves against the host root — `https://host/auth/token` — so set `tokenEndpoint` explicitly for path-prefixed deployments.

The Aidbox `Client` resource has to allow the grant:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Client",
  "id": "my-service",
  "secret": "your-client-secret",
  "grant_types": ["client_credentials"],
  "auth": { "client_credentials": { "access_token_expiration": 300 } }
}
```

Aidbox omits `expires_in` from the token response unless `auth.client_credentials.access_token_expiration` is set; the provider then assumes a 300 second lifetime.

**`ClientCredentialsAuthProvider` vs `SmartBackendServicesAuthProvider`:** both use the OAuth 2.0 client_credentials grant, but they prove client identity differently. `ClientCredentialsAuthProvider` presents a shared secret that both sides store, which is the simplest option for a service you deploy and configure yourself. `SmartBackendServicesAuthProvider` presents a private-key JWT assertion, so no secret ever leaves your process and only the public key is registered on the server — that is what the SMART Backend Services specification requires and what you need when talking to third-party FHIR servers.

### SmartBackendServicesAuthProvider

For server-to-server authentication using [SMART Backend Services](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/backend-services.html) (OAuth 2.0 client_credentials grant with JWT bearer assertion).

Features:
- Token caching with proactive refresh before expiry
- Thundering herd prevention — concurrent requests share a single token fetch
- Automatic retry on 401 with fresh token
- OAuth2 discovery from `.well-known/smart-configuration`

```typescript
import { AidboxClient, SmartBackendServicesAuthProvider } from "@health-samurai/aidbox-client";

// Generate or import your private key using Web Crypto API
const privateKey = await crypto.subtle.generateKey(
  { name: "RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5", modulusLength: 2048, publicExponent: new Uint8Array([1, 0, 1]), hash: "SHA-384" },
  true,
  ["sign", "verify"]
).then(kp => kp.privateKey);

const auth = new SmartBackendServicesAuthProvider({
  baseUrl: "https://fhir-server.address",
  clientId: "my-service",
  privateKey: privateKey,                     // CryptoKey from Web Crypto API
  keyId: "key-001",                           // Must match kid in JWKS
  scope: "system/*.read",
  // tokenExpirationBuffer: 30,              // Optional: seconds before expiry to refresh (default: 30)
});

const client = new AidboxClient("https://fhir-server.address", auth);
```

### SmartAppLaunchAuthProvider

For provider-facing applications that authenticate users via [SMART App Launch](https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/) (OAuth 2.0 authorization_code grant). Supports both **standalone launch** (user opens your app and selects a FHIR server) and **EHR launch** (the EHR opens your app via `?iss=...&launch=...`).

The provider holds no session state of its own — your application stores the `SmartSession` (in a cookie session, Redis, `sessionStorage`, etc.) and supplies `getSession` / `setSession` callbacks. This works the same way in a browser SPA and in a server app.

For confidential SMART clients, the `clientSecret` is intentionally **not** stored in `PendingAuthorization` or `SmartSession`. Persist those objects freely, but pass the secret separately in server-side code when calling `exchangeCode`, `refreshSession`, `revokeSession`, or `SmartAppLaunchAuthProvider`.

`exchangeCode()` stores token endpoint data in the session. When Aidbox includes `userinfo` in the token response, it is available as `session.userinfo`.

The flow has three stages, each backed by a top-level function:

1. `authorize(config)` — at the launch URL, returns `{ redirectUrl, pending }`. Persist `pending` keyed by `pending.stateNonce`, then redirect the user-agent to `redirectUrl`.
2. `exchangeCode({ url, pending })` — at the redirect URL, exchanges the `?code=...` for a `SmartSession`. Look up the previously stored `pending` using the `?state=...` query parameter. Confidential clients also pass `clientSecret` here.
3. `new SmartAppLaunchAuthProvider(...)` — for subsequent FHIR requests. Adds `Authorization: Bearer ...`, refreshes proactively before expiry, retries once on 401.

Features:
- Discovery via `.well-known/smart-configuration`
- PKCE with `S256` (configurable: `ifSupported` / `required` / `disabled`)
- Standalone and EHR launch detected by inspecting the launch URL
- Optional `issMatch` allow-list for the resolved `iss` (CSRF-style protection)
- Confidential clients (`clientSecret`) supported via HTTP Basic on the token endpoint without persisting secrets in `pending` or `session`
- Token refresh deduplication — concurrent FHIR requests share a single refresh

#### Server-side example (Express-style pseudocode)

```typescript
import {
  authorize,
  exchangeCode,
  AidboxClient,
  SmartAppLaunchAuthProvider,
  type PendingAuthorization,
  type SmartSession,
} from "@health-samurai/aidbox-client";

// 1. Launch route — both standalone and EHR launches arrive here.
//    For EHR launch the EHR appends `?iss=...&launch=...` to this URL.
app.get("/launch", async (req, res) => {
  const { redirectUrl, pending } = await authorize({
    iss: "https://fhir.example.com", // fallback for standalone; query iss wins for EHR
    clientId: process.env.SMART_CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: process.env.SMART_CLIENT_SECRET, // sets usesClientSecret without persisting the secret
    scope: "launch openid fhirUser patient/*.read offline_access",
    redirectUri: `${process.env.BASE_URL}/callback`,
    launchUrl: req.url, // lets the helper extract iss/launch from query params
    issMatch: /^https:\/\/(fhir|aidbox)\.example\.com$/,
  });

  req.session.pending = { [pending.stateNonce]: pending };
  res.redirect(redirectUrl);
});

// 2. Callback route — exchange the code for a session.
app.get("/callback", async (req, res) => {
  const stateNonce = new URL(req.url, process.env.BASE_URL).searchParams.get("state");
  const pending: PendingAuthorization = req.session.pending?.[stateNonce!];
  if (!pending) return res.status(400).send("Unknown state");

  const session = await exchangeCode({
    url: req.url,
    pending,
    clientSecret: process.env.SMART_CLIENT_SECRET,
  });

  req.session.smart = session;
  delete req.session.pending;
  res.redirect("/app");
});

// 3. Application route — use the provider for FHIR requests.
app.get("/app", async (req, res) => {
  const session: SmartSession | undefined = req.session.smart;
  if (!session) return res.redirect("/launch");

  const auth = new SmartAppLaunchAuthProvider({
    baseUrl: session.serverUrl,
    getSession: () => req.session.smart,
    setSession: (s) => { req.session.smart = s; },
    getClientSecret: () => process.env.SMART_CLIENT_SECRET,
  });

  const client = new AidboxClient(session.serverUrl, auth);
  const result = await client.read({ type: "Patient", id: session.patient! });
  res.json(result.value.resource);
});
```

#### Browser SPA example

The same three calls work in the browser — only the storage backend changes (here `sessionStorage`). Browser apps must use public SMART clients; confidential client secrets belong on the server only:

```typescript
import {
  authorize,
  exchangeCode,
  AidboxClient,
  SmartAppLaunchAuthProvider,
  type SmartSession,
} from "@health-samurai/aidbox-client";

// On the launch page (e.g. /launch.html)
const { redirectUrl, pending } = await authorize({
  iss: new URL(location.href).searchParams.get("iss") ?? "https://fhir.example.com",
  launchUrl: location.href,
  clientId: "my-spa",
  scope: "launch openid fhirUser patient/*.read",
  redirectUri: `${location.origin}/callback.html`,
});
sessionStorage.setItem(`smart:pending:${pending.stateNonce}`, JSON.stringify(pending));
location.href = redirectUrl;

// On the callback page (e.g. /callback.html)
const stateNonce = new URL(location.href).searchParams.get("state")!;
const pending = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem(`smart:pending:${stateNonce}`)!);
const session = await exchangeCode({ url: location.href, pending });
sessionStorage.setItem("smart:session", JSON.stringify(session));
sessionStorage.removeItem(`smart:pending:${stateNonce}`);
location.href = "/app.html";

// On any application page
const auth = new SmartAppLaunchAuthProvider({
  baseUrl: JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem("smart:session")!).serverUrl,
  getSession: () => JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem("smart:session")!) as SmartSession,
  setSession: (s) => sessionStorage.setItem("smart:session", JSON.stringify(s)),
});
const client = new AidboxClient(auth.baseUrl, auth);
```

#### Manual session management

`authorize`, `exchangeCode`, `refreshSession`, and `revokeSession` are exported as standalone functions and can be used without `SmartAppLaunchAuthProvider` if you want to manage tokens manually:

```typescript
import { refreshSession, revokeSession } from "@health-samurai/aidbox-client";

const refreshed = await refreshSession(session);  // returns a new SmartSession
await revokeSession(session);                     // best-effort revocation at the auth server

// Confidential clients pass the secret explicitly in server-side code:
const refreshedConfidential = await refreshSession(session, {
  clientSecret: process.env.SMART_CLIENT_SECRET,
});
await revokeSession(session, {
  clientSecret: process.env.SMART_CLIENT_SECRET,
});
```

> **Security note:** when scope includes `openid`, the token response carries an `id_token` JWT. This library does **not** validate the JWT signature, `iss`, `aud`, or `exp` — it stores the raw token in `session.idToken`. If you use id_token claims for authorization decisions, validate the JWT yourself first.

### Custom Auth Provider

For other authentication methods, implement the `AuthProvider` interface:

```typescript
import type { AuthProvider } from "@health-samurai/aidbox-client";

export class CustomAuthProvider implements AuthProvider {
  public baseUrl: string;

  constructor(baseUrl: string) {
    this.baseUrl = baseUrl;
  }

  public async establishSession() {
    /* code to establish a session */
  }

  public async revokeSession() {
    /* code to revoke the session */
  }

  /**
   * A wrapper around the `fetch` function, that does all the
   * necessary preparations and argument patching required for the
   * request to go through.
   *
   * Optionally, security checks can be implemented, like verifying
   * that the request indeed goes to the `baseUrl`, and not
   * somewhere else.
   */
  public async fetch(
    input: RequestInfo | URL,
    init?: RequestInit,
  ): Promise<Response> {
    /* ... */
  }
}
```
